Ordnance Survey's OS Road.json, in more Mapbox independent way

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS.

## Background
I am hosting OS Open Zoomstack vector tiles from the mbtiles supplied from OS at https://vectortiles.xyz/zxy/zoomstack/{z}/{x}/{y}. I want to give an example style to this in more Mapbox-independent way.

## Install
No need to install. This is hosted via gh-pages.

## Usage
FIXME.

## Note
- The OS Road.json is supplied by Ordnance Survey from https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Zoomstack-Stylesheets. The stylesheet is released by the [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/).
